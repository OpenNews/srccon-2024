### Let's build SRCCON together

# Our call for participation is open!

üóì **[We‚Äôre accepting session proposals through Friday, April 5](/participation/form).** Have an idea for SRCCON 2024? Take a look at [our proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/), then [tell us all about it](/participation/form)!

‚úèÔ∏è **SRCCON sessions are workshops, not panels. Conversations, not presentations.** This is a hands-on event about changing journalism‚Äîwe're looking for [topics you don't see at traditional conferences](/sessions/proposal-guide/#what-we-look-for) and sessions that help people imagine a better future together. Our whole program (including breaks and meals!) is about discussion and connection as peers. If you haven't led a session like that before, our [proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) is here to help (and [so are we](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)).

Our [call for participation form](/participation/form/) includes questions to tell us about all the ways you might want to participate at SRCCON, including as an attendee or a session facilitator. We will review entries and notify everyone by April 24. If invited to attend or facilitate a session, you will receive a link to purchase a ticket with [prices starting at $275 plus fees](/attendees/#tickets).

## Key dates for your calendar

* **March 20**: call for participation opens
* **April 5**: call for participation for sessions and scholarships closes
* **April 24**: we'll send out notifications about session proposals and scholarship applications
* **After April 24**: we'll review more participation forms for attendees only, on a rolling basis until the conference
* **August 15-16**: SRCCON takes place in Minneapolis, MN

Curious about how it all works? Learn more about [being a participant at SRCCON](/attendees) and [our call for participation form](/participation/form). There won't be a separate ticket lottery or sale date, so if you want to come to SRCCON 2024, our call for participation is how to let us know! As space remains available, we will keep the call for participation open for tickets after session proposal deadline, but applying by that date is your best chance to attend.

### When & where

On August 15-16 in Minneapolis, SRCCON returns to the [McNamara Alumni Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McNamara+Alumni+Center/@44.975199,-93.2301774,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b32d18ed516031:0x5f984f594ceab6ad!8m2!3d44.975199!4d-93.2279887). When tickets go on sale, we'll also open up a discounted block of rooms for participants at a nearby hotel.

We're excited to be back in Minneapolis! SRCCON 2024 will be in-person, and we are still developing our COVID safety policy for this event. It will be published when ticket sales open. We're gathering examples from other conferences such as [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2024/about/health-safety-guidelines/) and [NICAR](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2024/nicar24-faq/), and considering the specific needs and values of the OpenNews community as well. If you have any input, concerns, or needs, [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

### What you can expect

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON, you‚Äôll:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself‚Äînot panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism‚Äînot just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule‚Äîeven games & meals‚Äîas ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON events are highly participatory, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We support one another**‚Äîby offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**‚Äîby sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.
