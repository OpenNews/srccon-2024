### When & where

**DATE, at VENUE in CITY**

### About {{ page.event_name }}

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON, you’ll:

* be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself —not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even games & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON events are highly participatory, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.

### Who attends SRCCON events

SRCCON participants are developers, designers, journalists, editors, and allies: the practitioners and leaders who are transforming their newsrooms into more representative and innovative places to work. Participants come to SRCCON to change journalism by creating more intentional processes, better relationships with the communities they cover, and new ways to engage and inform people.

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the U.S. and many other countries. Each year, we particularly welcome journalists and allies from the city hosting SRCCON. Accessibility is a core value, and we offer [live session transcripts and tons of documentation](https://2019.srccon.org/documentation/) for those who can't attend in person.
