# Why sponsor SRCCON now

For journalism-technologists and newsroom leaders, SRCCON is a place to ‚Äúrecharge, reset, and reimagine.‚Äù You can help make that happen.

SRCCON is a journalism conference people love. This reaction comes from the approach SRCCON takes: highly participatory and extraordinarily inclusive. We're grateful for the support of sponsors in helping make this event possible.

As one attendee put it, SRCCON‚Äã ‚Äúmade me more confident about my media, my future, made me realize I was not alone in my view of journalism, it gave me hope for a journalism that truly represents me!‚Äù

## What is SRCCON?

OpenNews has been hosting SRCCON annually since 2014, and added a series of smaller, topical conferences starting in 2017. At SRCCON events, participants come first so they can focus on collaborating on the work at hand. Over this time SRCCON has:

* Welcomed more than 3,000 participants, with a healthy mix of new and returning attendees each time.
* Hosted more than 750 interactive, collaborative sessions on topics ranging from archiving and algorithms to management and self-care.
* Provided scholarship support to help hundreds of participants and facilitators attend these events.
* Operated with inclusion and accessibility as core design features, providing live transcription, childcare, tasty food and drink for all dietary needs, and a schedule with space to refresh and connect. This year, we're planning to offer digital accessibility across international timezones, and intentional programming for how attendees can digitally connect based on their needs.
* Created a code of conduct and incident response plan that supports attendees and has influenced the journalism community, including ONA and IRE conferences.
* Led to countless job connections, innovative project ideas and collaborations, and new organizational policies on hiring, inclusion, mentorship, workflow, development processes, and more.

## Who attends and why

People come first at SRCCON. Each event is set up to allow participants to focus on getting to know each other and learn from the wisdom in the room. About a third of participants also facilitate sessions, leading conversations and skillshares that help people bring new ideas and experience back to their newsrooms.

‚ÄúYou all are leading the way on how to have a great conference that is welcoming for everyone, and someday the tech industry will be so much better off when it adopts what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was the first conference I‚Äôve been a part of where I felt I belonged on every level.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy job very much straddles the line between technology and the newsroom and in 20 years of being in the newspaper (media) business, this is the first conference I‚Äôve been to that I felt like was specifically for me. I could contribute meaningfully to every session I went to.‚Äù
