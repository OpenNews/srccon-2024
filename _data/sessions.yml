    "description": "Engage in a conversation about what it would look like to do brave and bold journalism from a place of abundance. In industries with an abundance of capital of all kinds, these resources and investments often drive experimentation, competition, and rapid growth and exchange of ideas. In this session, we will talk about whether that kind of abundance context has ever been true for journalism. We’ll open up a conversation about what the most significant constraints are on our ability to innovate, experiment, and dream in the newsroom, whether it’s a lack of financial resources and economic stability, editorial support, or emotional capacity, health, and support in other parts of life.\n\nSecondly, we’ll discuss what possibilities would open up if any of these variables were changed. What stories would we pursue? What newsroom structures or models of journalism would we want to try? Finally, we’ll close out the conversation with a discussion about how we can pull ourselves towards the journalism industry we want to see. We may not be able to personally change the structural external realities of the challenges of the journalism industry, but we can approach our work from a mindset of abundance, openness and curiosity."

But in many news organizations there is a disconnect — and even distrust — between fundraising and newsroom staffs over fears of funder influence, concerns about editorial independence, and more.\n\nHowever, it doesn't need to be that way. In news organizations around the United States, fundraisers and journalists/technologists are collaborating and building a culture of philanthropy that supports their shared mission of great journalism. This session will offer case studies of how news organizations have built successful fundraising cultures, and participants will go through role-playing and idea-mapping exercises to identify how they can build a culture that bridges revenue/newsroom divides and leave with concrete steps they can take to change the culture of their organization. The principles in this session will be relevant to news organizations of all sizes and of all tax statuses."

Then we’ll open up a discussion about how we all might build up a culture of experimentation together.\n\nWe’ve found that across many news organizations, including our own, experimentation can feel like a lofty and vague concept. It’s often left to product teams or data scientists. Experimentation can be defined in many different ways without a shared understanding of how it might strengthen a strategy.

We would be eager to hold space to exchange ideas and experiences with other conference participants on how to encourage and pilot small-group peer support."

(Think: kind of like an exit interview but for those who just started, mixed with Nieman Lab-style predictions coming from younger voices.)\n\nOur panel will focus on three questions: What's worked so far? What hasn't worked? Where do you see things going? And will be a blend of pre-defined and open-forum questions. We invite other early-career attendees, and especially those in mid- to late-career, to come listen and ask questions.

    "description": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of journalism, technology — AI in particular — poses both a challenge and an opportunity. Many journalists experience hesitation and fear around using unfamiliar technology, worried about the high stakes of misinformation and the perceived need for expertise. However, the reality is that AI technology is already interwoven into our daily lives in many subtle ways, from predictive text to content recommendation systems. This session will explore how newsrooms can foster an environment of experimentation and openness around AI use, by creating an experimental “sandbox” of content within their publication wherein journalists can play, test, and explore AI tools without risking the integrity of their work, and publish the results of those experiments alongside honest reflections of their experience using AI. By approaching AI with this kind of radical transparency, journalists can demystify AI, encourage its ethical use, and foster a culture of trust and openness with readers.\n\nAttendees will learn about the way that LocalNewsMatters.org has employed this approach, and engage in a conversation about the tangible benefits of incorporating AI tools into journalism, the risks of doing so, and how embracing total transparency with readers can help to tackle both the positives and the negatives of this technology. This session will highlight the importance of journalists not only exploring AI uses in their own work, but critically assessing these tools to ensure ethical and responsible use and sharing that honest analysis with readers so that they may gain a better understanding of the applications and limitations of AI. This approach has the potential to build trust with audiences in an era of skepticism towards the media and to empower journalists of all technological backgrounds to embrace these powerful tools.\n\nBy sharing insights, experiences, and the impact of this initiative, the session aims to inspire other newsrooms to adopt similar strategies of experimentation, reflection, and transparency. This is not just about leveraging technology but about fostering a culture where journalists feel equipped and confident to navigate the complexities of digital innovation, ensuring the integrity and credibility of their work in the digital age."

And with an uptick in privacy protections and diminishing third-party data, standard metrics are losing value.\n\nHow can we actually reach the intended and interested audience that wants to give us attention?

Conversely, how would you navigate your community differently if you were no longer a journalist?\n\nIn this session, we’ll cover top-level findings from the Stayers and Leavers report, and create a shared sense of why this work is important to us as individuals. We'll also talk about the things in your job that keep you from showing up the way you envision.\n\nAt the end of the session, participants will leave with a doc with key themes discussed. With attendee permission, we would also like to publish these illustrations on our website."

What can journalists learn from the process of reframing our shared visual imaginary?\n\nWe’ll also think about ways publications protect the labor and work of visual artists like photojournalists, documentary filmmakers and editorial illustrators as AI image generation becomes mainstream. Is there a future where news and documentary visuals and AI-generated images are more compatible?\n\nThroughout this strategy session, we’ll work together to compile a set of considerations and guiding questions for journalists, image-makers and newsroom decision-makers trying to understand the impact of AI generated visuals."

In this workshop, we’ll check the editing, producing and managing at the door, and instead invite caring, coaching, and connecting to the table.\n\nAt its core, trauma-informed leadership is about respecting the things that happen to us and in us, then responding accordingly. I want to workshop the soft skill of leadership because, let’s be honest, it’s really hard. I also believe the soft skills of news organizations will retain the most critical perspectives and pivotal voices — those from journalists of color and women."

Times has conducted listening sessions to report on all sorts of topics, from [Asian American mental health](https://www.latimes.com/projects/mental-health-mandarin-chinese-how-to/) to [Hollywood careers](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-06-28/la-times-entertainment-career-guide-hollywood-dreamers). These off-the-record conversations in a small-group setting allow us to create a space for community members to candidly share their experiences, especially when discussing a sensitive topic. Participants actively help us shape the direction and sometimes even the design presentation of the final story in a way that becomes a helpful evergreen resource for that community.\n\nWe will share how we reported our bilingual mental health conversation guides, in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese, and our Hollywood careers guide, which has collected advice for over 30 entertainment industry jobs.\n\nDuring this session, we’ll work together to build a shared resource on how to incorporate listening sessions into your reporting. We’ll talk about the lessons we learned, brainstorm story topics and areas where listening sessions could be useful (and when they aren’t), explore best practices for recruiting participants, identify tools to help you moderate sessions and discuss any challenges that may arise when setting one up. We hope attendees will walk away with a toolkit and ideas to incorporate listening sessions in their work."

    "description": "In 1979’s \"The Timeless Way of Building,\" Christopher Alexander makes the case that ordinary people can design — and for centuries, have designed — buildings, landscapes, and towns without special training or the help of architects or elaborate plans. Instead, they rely on a “pattern language” — discrete repeated elements of design that in turn reflect repeated patterns of human behavior. For example, to build a traditional stone house in southern Italy, a person might make use of the following patterns: “Square main room, about 3 meters; two step main entrance; small rooms off the main room; arch between rooms; etc.”\nJust as verbal language allows speakers to combine words to create infinite novel sentences, a pattern language allows for the construction of an infinite variety of buildings that are nonetheless instantly recognizable and usable and that, in Alexander’s words, “feel alive.” Crucially, using a pattern language doesn’t require special training or knowledge; it is something that we call carry inside, even if we rarely acknowledge it explicitly.\n\nIn this session, we will work in small groups to begin to discover a pattern language for visual journalism by analyzing the common, repeated elements across a range of examples of work and the patterns of use they reflect, and by looking into our own practices to find the patterns we continually reach for because we know them to be true. The hope is that, whether you consider yourself a designer or not, learning to recognize and describe these patterns will help you to build projects that respond to users needs and, ideally, also “feel alive.”"

This workshop acknowledges the reality of AI development: failures are not just possible, they are a valuable part of the learning process. Through a series of discussion prompts and case studies we will delve into the complexities of AI missteps. Our goal is to equip participants with the knowledge that they can lead their initiatives with confidence and strategic thought even when they do not go as planned."
