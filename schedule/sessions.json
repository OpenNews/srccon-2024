Through our recent report, The Power of Peer Support, we heard again and again that journalists prefer to seek support from other journalists who understand the unique stressors of the profession, but do not have the resources to do so.\n\nAn important, promising solution we found in our research was small-group peer support, a model which creates spaces for journalists to receive support from peers who share their identity and/or lived experience, have their experiences seen and heard, and share coping mechanisms and support. We would be eager to hold space to exchange ideas and experiences with other conference participants on how to encourage and pilot small-group peer support.",

What visual motifs do we rely on to communicate data? What work should we expect feature art to do for a story? How do we communicate live updating data in a static image? How do you navigate the cross-department dynamics of art and graphics? How does art change depending on the platform it's shared on?",

Often times, actually deploying and hosting these products requires bandwidth, technical savvy, and money local newsrooms don't have to spare. We can't solve those resource shortages in a session, but we can learn what it means to run software \"locally.\" Let's tackle our fear of the command line, develop a little bit of software documentation literacy, and run an app on our computers!\n\nBy the end of the session, we will have shared a resource that takes folks through the tedious steps (creating a Github account and authenticating), and some of the places to get help when you run into obstacles like nasty Python environment bugs (Stack Overflow, News Nerdery, etc.). That resource will also list some useful open-source projects folks can try running locally (we would love to add to the resource in the session!). We might not be able to get everyone up and running by the end of our time, but we will get *some* folks through it and, perhaps more importantly, show our debugging process.

We’ll talk about the lessons we learned, brainstorm story topics and areas where listening sessions could be useful (and when they aren’t), explore best practices for recruiting participants, identify tools to help you moderate sessions and discuss any challenges that may arise when setting one up.

But in many news organizations there is a disconnect — and even distrust — between fundraising and newsroom staffs over fears of funder influence, concerns about editorial independence, and more.\n\nHowever, it doesn't need to be that way. In news organizations around the United States, fundraisers and journalists/technologists are collaborating and building a culture of philanthropy that supports their shared mission of great journalism. This session will offer case studies of how news organizations have built successful fundraising cultures, and participants will go through role-playing and idea-mapping exercises to identify how they can build a culture that bridges revenue/newsroom divides and leave with concrete steps they can take to change the culture of their organization. The principles in this session will be relevant to news organizations of all sizes and of all tax statuses.",

What product features might reify feelings of moral injury and powerlessness, and what product features might ameliorate them? What would it look like for a news product to be designed to engender agency and accountability?",

    "description": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of journalism, technology — AI in particular — poses both a challenge and an opportunity. Many journalists experience hesitation and fear around using unfamiliar technology, worried about the high stakes of misinformation and the perceived need for expertise. However, the reality is that AI technology is already interwoven into our daily lives in many subtle ways, from predictive text to content recommendation systems. This session will explore how newsrooms can foster an environment of experimentation and openness around AI use, by creating an experimental “sandbox” of content within their publication wherein journalists can play, test, and explore AI tools without risking the integrity of their work, and publish the results of those experiments alongside honest reflections of their experience using AI. By approaching AI with this kind of radical transparency, journalists can demystify AI, encourage its ethical use, and foster a culture of trust and openness with readers.\n\nAttendees will learn about the way that LocalNewsMatters.org has employed this approach, and engage in a conversation about the tangible benefits of incorporating AI tools into journalism, the risks of doing so, and how embracing total transparency with readers can help to tackle both the positives and the negatives of this technology. This session will highlight the importance of journalists not only exploring AI uses in their own work, but critically assessing these tools to ensure ethical and responsible use and sharing that honest analysis with readers so that they may gain a better understanding of the applications and limitations of AI. This approach has the potential to build trust with audiences in an era of skepticism towards the media and to empower journalists of all technological backgrounds to embrace these powerful tools.\n\nBy sharing insights, experiences, and the impact of this initiative, the session aims to inspire other newsrooms to adopt similar strategies of experimentation, reflection, and transparency. This is not just about leveraging technology but about fostering a culture where journalists feel equipped and confident to navigate the complexities of digital innovation, ensuring the integrity and credibility of their work in the digital age.",

In this session, Abby Blachman, product engineer and current Sulzberger fellow, will share what we’re learning about the [top-down](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/alexandra-smith-metrics-readership-19th-impact.php) and [bottom-up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s3KigWCB28vhRGL8-N9w_uEc-WlazJVU/view) experimentation frameworks we’ve been testing alongside the cultural and technical challenges we’re facing in our organization. Then we’ll open up a discussion about how we all might build up a culture of experimentation together.\n\nWe’ve found that across many news organizations, including our own, experimentation can feel like a lofty and vague concept. It’s often left to product teams or data scientists. Experimentation can be defined in many different ways without a shared understanding of how it might strengthen a strategy.

And with an uptick in privacy protections and diminishing third-party data, standard metrics are losing value.\n\nHow can we actually reach the intended and interested audience that wants to give us attention? What are our habits in consuming news and how do those differ from people working outside of the media?

    "description": "In 1979’s \"The Timeless Way of Building,\" Christopher Alexander makes the case that ordinary people can design — and for centuries, have designed — buildings, landscapes, and towns without special training or the help of architects or elaborate plans. Instead, they rely on a “pattern language” — discrete repeated elements of design that in turn reflect repeated patterns of human behavior. For example, to build a traditional stone house in southern Italy, a person might make use of the following patterns: “Square main room, about 3 meters; two step main entrance; small rooms off the main room; arch between rooms; etc.”\nJust as verbal language allows speakers to combine words to create infinite novel sentences, a pattern language allows for the construction of an infinite variety of buildings that are nonetheless instantly recognizable and usable and that, in Alexander’s words, “feel alive.” Crucially, using a pattern language doesn’t require special training or knowledge; it is something that we call carry inside, even if we rarely acknowledge it explicitly.\n\nIn this session, we will work in small groups to begin to discover a pattern language for visual journalism by analyzing the common, repeated elements across a range of examples of work and the patterns of use they reflect, and by looking into our own practices to find the patterns we continually reach for because we know them to be true. The hope is that, whether you consider yourself a designer or not, learning to recognize and describe these patterns will help you to build projects that respond to users needs and, ideally, also “feel alive.”",
